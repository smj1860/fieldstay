-- SUPERSEDED — moved to _unshipped/ during the 2026-07-28 migration-drift
-- reconciliation (Task 4). Confirmed via Supabase MCP list_migrations that
-- this file's version was never recorded in supabase_migrations.schema_migrations,
-- and via live schema introspection (information_schema.tables/columns,
-- pg_proc, pg_indexes) that every table/column/index/function/policy this
-- file targets already exists in the live database — applied under a
-- different, real-timestamped migration that superseded this draft. Kept
-- for historical reference only; do not run.
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- NOT RECORDED IN LIVE MIGRATION HISTORY: verified via Supabase MCP
-- list_migrations against project vpmznjktllhmmbfnxuvk on 2026-07-08 that
-- this file's version is absent from supabase_migrations.schema_migrations.
-- Spot-checking the schema objects it defines (tables, columns, indexes,
-- functions, policies, enum values, dropped objects) against the live
-- database confirms they already exist — this SQL was applied previously,
-- most likely by hand or under a different, already-tracked migration
-- timestamp, and this file is a historical/duplicate copy rather than a
-- pending change. Do not assume `supabase db push` needs to run it, and
-- verify against the live schema before treating it as authoritative —
-- some statements here (UPDATEs, INSERTs, ALTER TYPE ... ADD VALUE) are
-- not safely re-runnable if actually executed again.
-- ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- Adds two columns that application code already references but that do not
-- exist in the current schema, causing silent failures in template operations.
